 * 56. Merge Intervals
 * <p>
 * Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 * Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
 * Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
 * Output: [[1,5]]
 * Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * Input: intervals = [[4,7],[1,4]]
 * Output: [[1,7]]
 * Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,7] are considered overlapping.
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
 * intervals[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^4
