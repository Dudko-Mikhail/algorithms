 * 141. Linked List Cycle
 * <p>
 * Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
 * Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
 * Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
 * -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
 * pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
 * <p>
 * Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?
